# TSOHA_discussionForum
Repository for the database application course arranged by Helsinki University. The application is intended to provide a discussion forum.

Out of the suggested topics, I decided to implement the discussion forum application. The theme of the discussion forum is still open, but I did not consider it too important at this stage. However, I have considered something related to a MMO RPG called "World of Warcraft". Alternative theme could be related to renewable energy sources and their integration to power systems.

The target is to implement at least the properties listed in the course git hub page, i.e.,
- The user can create an account and log in.
- The used can see the list of the different discussion areas for each subtopic related to the theme of the forum. In addition, the number of messages and threads can be seen for each subtopic, as well as the timestamp for the most recent post.
- The user can create new threads by giving the thread a title and the content of the starting message.
- The user can reply to existing threads.
- The user can modify the title of their own threads, as well as the content of their own messages. Own threads and messages can also be deleted.
- The user can search the discussion forum for messages that include the word they searched for.
- Users may have moderation rights, which enables them to add and delete separate discussion areas to the forum.
- The user with moderation rights can create a private discussion area and define, which users have access to it.
